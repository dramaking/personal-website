      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">Started in 2013 by McCormacks brothers, Fleetpin is a New Zealand tech
        company providing cloud based GPS tracking and fleet management solutions. It quickly won popularity with its
        simple to use UI from small to medium sized customers who favors "just enough" solution instead of the apps
        clustered with massive tables and features that are only usable for larger companies. </p>

      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">In 5 years, Fleetpin transformed to a company with over 400 customers
        managing more than 3000 GPS devices throughout New Zealand and Pacific. The industries that Fleetpin products
        target covers trades, construction, buses, machinery hire and agriculture. And the scale of fleet they manage
        can varies from a single asset to over 200 assets. </p>
      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">The Fleetpin App, designed in 2013, struggled to scale alongside the
        growth of the company. Initially made for tracking asset and activities, multiple features were introduced to
        deal with fleet management and the diversity of the customers. Fundamental usability was challenged. Disparate
        features and experiments competed for focus. And the development frameworks were out of date and becoming hard
        to scale.</p>

      <h3 class="project__full-paragraph__title">The Challenge</h3>
      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">It was becoming evident that a complete redesign and rebuild were needed
        to recapture the magic that Fleetpin used to have, to create a strong foundation that embraced a rapidly
        evolving business and more diverse user base.</p>
      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">Our goals were to:</p>
      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">1. Making it easy and fast to use for companies of all scales. <br> 2.
        Redesigning the UI, while keeping it familiar as Fleetpin V1. <br> 3. Creating a scalable, secure and modern
        platform.</p>
      <h3 class="project__full-paragraph__title">My Role</h3>
      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">I am the sole UX Designer and Front-end Developer in this project. In
        early 2018, I took over the responsibility of product management from the CEO.</p>
      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">I collaborated with the CEO and a Back-end Developer in our product team.
        In addition, I work alongside Sales Manager and Customer Support Representative for idea validation.</p>
      <h3 class="project__full-paragraph__title">Getting the right structure</h3>
      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">The original Fleetpin Web App was mainly built for tracking live GPS
        status and checking activity history. With the rapid growth of users from different industries, multiple
        features were added for the purpose of fleet management. The user interface quickly got clutered with misplaced
        buttons and navigation. And it was becoming difficult to add advanced features due to the limitness of the UI.
      </p>
      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">One of the biggest challenges I faced throughout the Fleetpin V2 project
        was balancing keeping it simple to use, whilst incorporating features that meet the companies of all sizes and
        types. With multiple design meetings and iterations, the new app is consisted of two main features - Tracking
        and Dashboard. The manager of small fleet can simply use "Tracking" to check the asset location, while larger
        fleet can benefit from advanced features in the "Dashboard".</p>

      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">Fleetpin users really like the live tracking and activity history in the
        original version. With most of the fleet management features stripping away, I was tasked to create a familiar
        but better experience for users to track "where they are and where they have been". </p>

      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">Stripping away the noise was a challenging task. With so much data coming
        from the GPS device, it is so easy to overload users with redundant information. During the design process, I
        kept asking myself "what information does user really care to see at that moment", and only show those
        information when they need it. I created a strong correlation between the map and the rest of the UI, so that
        information can be displayed interactively and intuitively.</p>

      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">An average GPS device sends live data to Fleetpin Data Service every 20
        seconds, that's over 4000 activities collected in a single day. Displaying these data properly is a challenging
        task in Fleetpin V1. In Fleetpin V2, we want these data to be smarter and make business sense. Not only do we
        want to visualise the data, but also to convey useful information for fleet managers to take immediate actions.
      </p>
      <p class="project__full-paragraph__text">I was tasked with the design and development of the report features.
        Instead of analysing the data itself, I got started from the user's perspective and then find data that would
        meet their use cases. This approach allowed us to greatly trim down the number of reports which provide less
        burden for users to make choices.</p>
